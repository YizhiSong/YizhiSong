# 👋 Hi, I'm Yizhi Song

I'm a postdoctoral researcher in the Physics Department at Temple University. My research focuses on computational condensed matter physics, especially the structural and electronic properties of water and ice. I use first-principles and machine learning-based molecular dynamics simulations to explore complex systems at the atomic level.
